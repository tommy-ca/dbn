# Phase 0 – Product Requirements & Strategy

This phase captures the market analyses and acceptance criteria that justify every change to the DBN schemas.

## Files

- [CRYPTO_DBN_QUICK_REFERENCE.md](CRYPTO_DBN_QUICK_REFERENCE.md) – Executive briefing that explains motivation, KPIs, and high-level taxonomies for crypto coverage.
- [CRYPTO_DBN_REQUIREMENTS_AND_SPECS.md](CRYPTO_DBN_REQUIREMENTS_AND_SPECS.md) – Deep requirements, gap analysis, and acceptance criteria that seed the downstream specification and design work.

## When to edit

Start here whenever new markets, latency goals, or regulatory obligations appear. Every schema change request should link back to a section in one of these documents so reviewers can trace intent.
